## 2. Patterns and Trends

### Interesting Patterns Observed

#### **1. Revenue Heatmap Patterns**
The revenue heatmap (Day of Week vs Week of Year) reveals:

- **No Strong Day-of-Week Pattern**: Unlike typical leisure hotels with Friday-Sunday peaks, ResortChain shows distributed revenue across all days
- **Suggests Mixed Business Model**: Combination of leisure (weekend) and business/extended-stay (weekday) guests
- **High Variability**: Wide range from €0 to €8,578 on different days
- **No Predictable Seasonality**: Given limited 8-month window (Jan-Aug), typical seasonal patterns not yet evident

#### **2. Expense Consistency**
Monthly expenses show remarkable stability:
- Payroll: Highly consistent monthly payments
- Tax payments: Regular quarterly/monthly schedule
- Insurance & Maintenance: Predictable recurring expenses
- **Insight**: This consistency aids cash flow forecasting but reduces flexibility

#### **3. FX Transaction Volume**
- 153 FX transactions over 8 months (avg 19/month)
- Consistent monthly occurrence
- **Pattern suggests**: Regular international payments or multi-currency revenue collection
- **Opportunity**: Potential for FX cost optimization (see recommendations)

#### **4. Balance Deviations**
Monthly balance deviations between expected (from transactions) and actual (from snapshots):
- Deviations range from -€2,788 to +€3,429
- **March shows largest positive deviation** (+€2,860)
- **July shows largest negative deviation** (-€2,788)
- Average absolute deviation: €1,621
- **Possible causes**: 
  - Timing differences between booking_date and value_date
  - Unrecorded transactions or fees
  - Data collection artifacts

#### **5. Investment Behavior**
Monthly investment purchases show tactical approach:
- Lowest in April (€815) - possible cash conservation
- Highest in January (€3,904) and July-August (€3,490-€3,611)
- **Pattern suggests**: Opportunistic investment when cash allows, reduction during tight periods

### Seasonal Trends and Cyclical Behaviors

#### **Limited Seasonal Evidence (8-Month Window)**
With only January-August data available, typical hotel seasonality (summer peak) is partially observable but incomplete:

- **Revenue Volatility**: Present throughout all months
- **No Clear Summer Peak**: Would expect June-August surge for French luxury resort, but data shows:
  - Jan: €68,956 revenue
  - Jun: €70,945 revenue  
  - Jul: €61,258 revenue
  - Aug: €66,803 revenue
  - **Pattern**: Relatively flat, suggesting year-round appeal or mixed business/leisure clientele

#### **Weekly Patterns (Micro-Level)**
- Revenue distributed across all days of week
- No strong Friday-Sunday leisure pattern
- **Suggests**: Business travelers, extended stays, or international guests with varied check-in patterns

#### **Expense Cyclicality**
- Payroll: Consistent monthly (no seasonal staffing adjustments observed)
- Tax: Appears quarterly (larger payments in certain months)
- Other expenses: Stable monthly pattern

## 3. Forecasting Analysis

### System Forecasts vs Actual Performance

**Note**: The analysis focused on actual transaction patterns. The system_forecasts.csv and user_forecasts.csv datasets were loaded but not deeply analyzed in the current charts. However, from the data structure:

#### **System Forecasts Dataset Structure:**
- 108 forecast entries
- 20 columns of forecast categories
- ML-generated predictions for various cash flow categories

#### **Preliminary Observations:**
1. **Data Quality**: Both forecast datasets exist with structured category data
2. **Forecasting Capability**: Organization has invested in ML forecasting infrastructure
3. **User Engagement**: 267 user forecast entries indicate active finance team participation

#### **Recommended Follow-Up Analysis** (Not Yet Completed):
- Compare forecasted vs actual monthly revenue
- Analyze forecast accuracy by category (Payroll, Tax, Revenue)
- Identify which categories have highest prediction errors
- Evaluate user forecast quality vs ML system forecasts

### Insights from Forecasting Data

Based on available data structure (detailed analysis pending):

1. **Sophisticated Forecasting Infrastructure**: Having both system and user forecasts indicates mature financial planning
2. **Multi-Category Approach**: 20 forecast columns suggest detailed category-level planning
3. **Opportunity for Validation**: With 8 months of actual data, forecast accuracy can be thoroughly evaluated

### Patterns in User-Generated Forecasts

**Available for Analysis** (267 entries across 18 columns):
- User forecasts provide human judgment layer over ML predictions
- Comparison of user vs system forecasts could reveal:
  - Areas where finance team consistently adjusts ML predictions
  - Category-specific domain knowledge
  - Bias patterns or conservative/aggressive tendencies

**Recommendation**: Dedicate separate analysis to forecast performance evaluation

## 4. Data Quality and Anomalies

### Data Quality Assessment: **HIGH QUALITY**

#### **Strengths:**

1. **Excellent Transaction Categorization**
   - Clean `additional_info` field with consistent format: "Category - Description"
   - Clear `credit_or_debit` indicators
   - Proper creditor/debtor name fields
   - Professional-grade data structure

2. **Complete Critical Fields**
   - No missing amounts
   - All transactions have dates (value_date and booking_date)
   - Currency field populated (EUR)
   - Reference numbers for traceability

3. **Proper Date Handling**
   - Both `value_date` and `booking_date` provided
   - Enables accurate cash flow vs accounting analysis
   - Critical for reconciliation

4. **Balance Reconciliation Available**
   - 243 balance snapshots over 8 months
   - Enables independent verification of transaction accuracy
   - Professional control mechanism

#### **Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Date Column Ambiguity**
   - Some charts use `value_date`, others `booking_date`
   - **Discrepancy identified**: Balance deviation analysis shows differences
   - **Impact**: Affects daily cash flow accuracy
   - **Recommendation**: Standardize on `value_date` for cash flow, `booking_date` for accounting

2. **Missing Revenue Detail**
   - Hotel revenue shown as aggregate daily amounts
   - No breakdown by: room type, booking channel, guest nationality
   - Limits revenue optimization analysis

3. **Potential Unrecorded Transactions**
   - Balance deviations suggest possible missing transactions or fees
   - Bank fees, card processing fees may not be fully captured
   - Could explain cash decline vs near-break-even operations

### Unusual or Interesting Transactions

#### **1. High-Value Single Days**
- Several days with €8,000+ revenue spikes
- **Possible explanations**:
  - Large group bookings
  - Corporate events or conferences
  - Delayed payment processing (bulk settlements)
  - Premium suite bookings

#### **2. FX Bank Transaction Volume**
- 153 FX transactions in 8 months is exceptionally high
- Average 19 per month (nearly 1 per business day)
- **Questions raised**:
  - Why so frequent? Daily currency exchanges?
  - Are these cross-border payments to suppliers?
  - Multi-currency revenue collection?
- **Cost impact**: €46,154 in fees (€302 per transaction avg)

#### **3. Investment Purchase Timing**
- Investments made even as cash position declines
- Example: July shows €3,490 investment while cash dropping
- **Questions**:
  - Strategic treasury management or mandatory investments?
  - Could this cash be better deployed operationally?
  - What returns are these generating?

#### **4. Zero-Revenue Days**
The heatmap shows multiple days with zero revenue:
- **Not typical** for luxury resort (should have some occupancy)
- **Possible explanations**:
  - Data recording lags (settlements processed next day)
  - Maintenance closures
  - Data quality gaps
  - True zero-occupancy (concerning)

### Data Inconsistencies

#### **1. Balance Deviations (Previously Discussed)**
- Monthly deviations from -€2,788 to +€3,429
- Average absolute deviation: €1,621/month
- Suggests timing differences or missing transactions

#### **2. Income vs Expense Near-Parity Puzzle**
- 8-month period shows +€3,793 net income (nearly break-even)
- Yet cash declined by €186,909 (30%)
- **€183,116 gap unexplained**
- **Potential causes**:
  - Starting balance includes pre-January operations
  - Missing transaction categories
  - Accounting vs cash timing (receivables/payables)
  - Data extraction issues

#### **3. French Holidays Impact - Unclear**
Chart 5 overlays French bank holidays on income:
- **No obvious pattern** of reduced revenue on holidays
- Expected: Lower business travel on holidays
- Observed: Revenue appears random relative to holidays
- **Suggests**: International leisure guests unaffected by French holidays OR data insufficient for pattern detection
