‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ monthly_forecast_comparison.csv    (monthly aggregated)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ forecast_insights.json             (NEW - all insights)
```

**forecast_insights.json structure:**
```json
{
  "age_correlation": {
    "slope_per_week": 1.8,
    "base_mape": 8.5,
    "r_squared": 0.72,
    "interpretation": "Every 7 days adds 1.8% to error rate"
  },
  "category_difficulty": [
    {
      "category": "cash_out_payroll",
      "MAPE": 6.42,
      "forecast_method": "ml_model"
    }
  ],
  "user_patterns": {
    "total_forecasts": 500,
    "approval_rate": 45.2,
    "dismissal_rate": 54.8,
    "avg_amount": 125000,

    "top_categories": {}
  },
  "temporal_patterns": {
    "trend": "improving",
    "monthly_data": []
  }
}
```

### 3. New UI Components

**CategoryDifficultyChart** (`components/blocks/category_difficulty_chart.tsx`)
- Horizontal bar chart showing MAPE by category
- Color-coded: green (easy), blue (medium), amber (acceptable), red (hard)
- Shows best method for each category
- Interactive tooltips with method names

**UserForecastStatsCards** (`components/blocks/user_forecast_stats_cards.tsx`)
- Grid of 4 stat cards:
  1. Total Forecasts (with Users icon)
  2. Approval Rate (with CheckCircle icon)
  3. Dismissal Rate (with XCircle icon)
  4. Average Amount (with TrendingUp icon)
- Shows multiplier vs system forecasts

### 4. Updated Components

**forecast_comparison.tsx**
- Restructured with narrative flow answering 3 assignment questions:
  1. **System Forecast Performance**: Winner callout + accuracy table + age/difficulty insights
  2. **Forecast Insights & Patterns**: Monthly chart + category difficulty chart + 3 insight callouts
  3. **User Forecast Patterns**: Stats cards + dismissal/exceptional events callouts
- Fetches insights from new API endpoint
- Uses new CategoryDifficultyChart and UserForecastStatsCards
- Dynamic content based on actual data

### 5. New API Route

**`/api/forecast-insights`** (`app/api/forecast-insights/route.ts`)
- Serves the comprehensive insights JSON
- Error handling with fallback

### 6. Updated API Routes

All API routes now point to `datasets/forecast_analysis/` instead of `datasets/raw/`:
- `/api/forecast-accuracy`
- `/api/forecast-best-method`
- `/api/forecast-monthly`
- `/api/forecast-daily`

## How to Use
